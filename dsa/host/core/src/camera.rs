//! The host computer's cameras, used by the apps in the guest.
//!
//! The guest's camera provider HAL shows each camera of the host to Android as a camera of
//! its own. It opens one connection to the camera port to list the cameras, and one for each
//! camera an app opens. On that connection the host starts the camera at the size the app's
//! streams need and sends each picture as 8-bit 4:2:0 (NV12); the HAL fills the app's buffers
//! from it. A still picture (JPEG) is encoded on the host from the newest picture.
//!
//! [`serve_connection`] runs one connection: the handshake (a Hello of
//! [`Role::GuestCamera`], which needs no secret), the host's [`CameraList`], and then opens,
//! pictures and stills. Any guest process can reach the port, so every message is checked and
//! nothing the peer sends can take the host down: a bad request is an error on that
//! connection only. A camera the user has blocked in the computer's privacy settings is not
//! listed and does not open.
//!
//! The camera is held open only between the guest's `CameraOpen` and its `CameraStop` (or
//! the end of the connection), so the computer's camera light and its in-use indicator show
//! only while an app uses the camera.
//!
//! Nothing here names a host operating system API. The platform supplies the cameras through
//! [`Cameras`].

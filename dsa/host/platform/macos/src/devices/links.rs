//! Opening the web links apps in the user's Android open, in the user's default browser.
//!
//! The follower watches the links over the local API and hands each to `/usr/bin/open`,
//! which starts the browser the user chose in System Settings. Only http and https links it
//! has checked itself are handed on: given a file path or another scheme, `open` would start
//! whatever app handles it, and an app in Android must never be able to do that. The link is
//! one argument, never shell text, and it starts with `http`, so `open` cannot take it for
//! one of its options.

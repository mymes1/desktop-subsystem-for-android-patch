//! The pacing of one task's frames between the renderer and the app's window host.
//!
//! Each task has two shared frame surfaces. The window host reads the one it was last told
//! of until it answers that the frame is on screen; the renderer meanwhile writes the other.
//! A frame that is ready while the window host still reads waits, and a newer frame written
//! over it replaces it, so the window always catches up to the newest frame and the guest
//! never waits for a window. A window host that does not answer in time is not waited for any
//! longer.

//! Paging an idle app's memory back to zram soon after something woke it.
//!
//! The idle reclaim ([`crate::reclaim`]) moves cold anonymous memory to zram for the whole
//! guest, but only when the guest goes idle or grows. Between those, a background process that
//! wakes (Google Play services checking in, a broadcast, even `dumpsys` asking it for its
//! state) reads its swapped-out pages back, and they stay resident until the next global
//! reclaim. Google Play services went from 30 to 73 MiB resident on each wake that way.
//!
//! So the daemon watches the app processes that no window shows, and when one has used the CPU
//! and then gone quiet for a few seconds, it asks the kernel to page that process's anonymous
//! memory out (`process_madvise` with `MADV_PAGEOUT`). The kernel moves only the pages nothing
//! else maps, to zram, where they take about a third of their size; what the process touches
//! again comes back on demand.
//!
//! Which processes: an app's (its app ID at least 10000), never one whose package has a task
//! window open, never the foreground app or one the user can see (`oom_score_adj` below
//! [`VISIBLE_APP_ADJ`]), and otherwise one at perceptible importance or lower
//! (`oom_score_adj` [`PERCEPTIBLE_APP_ADJ`] and up). Google Play services' processes, which
//! other apps and the system bind and so often sit just above perceptible without anything to
//! show, are taken from [`VISIBLE_APP_ADJ`] up. Each process is paged out at most every
//! [`PageoutPolicy::min_interval`], only after it has grown by [`PageoutPolicy::min_growth_kb`]
//! since the last time, and one process at most per look, so the daemon never competes with
//! the apps for the CPU.
//!
//! The decision runs and is tested on any platform; [`system`] reads `/proc` and asks the
//! kernel on Linux and Android.

/**
 * Keeps off the parts of Google Play services that run all the time on a phone and have no
 * use on a desktop: crisis alerts, the emergency location service, motion sickness assist,
 * nearby device presence, Cast device suggestions, remote gestures from a watch, the
 * hardware activity recognition provider, Find My Device's secure lock, and the cross-device
 * service. Each is a service Play services starts at boot and keeps running in its main
 * process, so each costs resident memory for as long as Android runs. None of them carries
 * push messages, accounts, the Play Store, location for apps, Play Integrity or backup; those
 * run in other services of the same process, which stay as they are.
 *
 * The state is put back whenever it may have been lost: when the agent starts (at every
 * boot), when Play services is installed or updated, and when its components change. Play
 * services turns its own components on and off as its modules download and its server flags
 * change, and each of those changes reaches the agent as a component change of the package,
 * so a component it turns back on is off again a moment later ([SETTLE_MILLIS], which lets a
 * burst of changes end first). The services are turned off without ending the process, so
 * push connections and sign-ins survive.
 *
 * Should Play services keep turning a component back on, the agent stops after
 * [MAX_REAPPLY] times within [REAPPLY_WINDOW_MILLIS] and logs it, rather than fight it
 * forever.
 *
 * Without Google Play services installed this does nothing. Not thread safe: the agent calls
 * it from its scheduler's thread.
